# Using FlightSQL to Connect to Ballista

One of the easiest ways to start with Ballista is to plug it into your existing data infrastructure using support for Arrow Flight SQL JDBC.

Getting started involves these main steps:

1. [Installing prerequisites](#prereq)
2. Build the [Ballista rust code](#rust)
3. Build and run the [Ballista docker containers](#docker)
4. Build the [Arrow Flight SQL JDBC Driver](#jdbc)
5. [Install the driver](#tool) into your favorite JDBC tool
6. Run a ["hello, world!"](#hello) query
7. Register a table and run more complicated queries

## <a name="prereq"/>Prerequisites

### Ubuntu

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose
```

### MacOS

```shell
brew install docker docker-compose
```

### Windows

```shell
choco install docker-desktop docker-compose
```

## <a name="rust"/>Building Ballista

To build in docker (non-linux systems):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista.git
dev/build-ballista-rust.sh
```

Or in linux-based systems with the correct dependencies installed, one can simply:

```shell
cargo build --release --all --features flight-sql
```

## <a name="docker"/> Run Docker Containers

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

## <a name="jdbc"/>Build the FlightSQL JDBC Driver

**Note:** this will no longer be necessary when Arrow v10 is released approximately 2022-10-31

**Note:** A full explaination of the Arrow Java build is out-of-scope for this document. Please refer to that project for more detailed instructions.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow.git
cd java
mvn install -DskipTests -Dcheckstyle.skip -Drat.skip=true -pl :flight-sql-jdbc-driver -am
find . -name "*.jar"
...
./flight/flight-sql-jdbc-driver/target/flight-sql-jdbc-driver-10.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
...
```

## <a name="tool"/>Use the Driver in your Favorite Data Tool

The important pieces of information:

| Key              | Value                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Driver file      | flight-sql-jdbc-driver-10.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar         |
| Class Name       | org.apache.arrow.driver.jdbc.ArrowFlightJdbcDriver |
| Authentication   | User & Password                                    |
| Username         | admin                                              |

| Advanced Options | useEncryption=false                                |
| URL              | jdbc:arrow-flight://127.0.0.1:50050                |

## <a name="hello"/>Run a "Hello, World!" Query

```sql
select 'Hello from Arrow Ballista!' as greeting;
```

## <a name="complex"/>Run a Complex Query

In order to run queries against data, tables need to be "registered" with the current session (and re-registered upon each new connection).

To register a table, find a `.csv`, `.json`, or `.parquet` file for testing, and use the syntax below:

```sql
create external table customer stored as CSV with header row
    location '/path/to/customer.csv';
```

Once the table has been registered, all the normal SQL queries can be performed:

```sql
select * from customer;
```

ðŸŽ‰ Happy querying! ðŸŽ‰
